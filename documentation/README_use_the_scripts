Documentation for use of the create-vm and destroy-vm scripts

last update: 2013-09-26

### Scope

	These scripts have been tested only on a host os of Ubuntu 12.04 server edition
	
### Introduction

	create-vm automates the process to create a vm as documented in README_create_vm_manually
	
	remove-vm automates the removal of a vm as documented in README_create_vm_manually
	
	ubuntu.config is an example config file for use with create-vm.
	Many of the variables for building a vm are placed in filename.config
	A remaining few variables are entered on the command line

### Setup

# create directories in the host OS

	mkdir -p ~/admin/kvm/config
	
# --> move the two scripts, create-vm and remove-vm to ~/admin/kvm

# --> move the ubuntu.config file to ~/admin/kvm/config

	# otherwise change this line as appropriate in create-vm
	
		config_path=~/admin/kvm/config
	
	# edit the right side of the assignments in the config file to suit your needs. 
	# make additional config files as necessary
	# the config filename is one of the command line arguments to create-vm
	
# chmod the scripts for execution

	chmod 755 ~/admin/kvm/create-vm
	chmod 755 ~/admin/kvm/remove-vm

### Running the scripts

# run the scrips with 'help' to see the command line arguments and an example

	cd ~/admin/kvm
	./create-vm help
	./remove-vm help

# create-vm

	the create-vm script will create a virtual machine and will take about 10 minutes to run. There will be output along the way. 
	
	Some disconcerting output messages are normal. For example:

	-- snip --

# remove-vm

	A vm must be "scrubbed" before it can be re-created with the same hostname, or you will get an "vm already exists" or similar error. Certain virsh commands must be run, and files and directories removed. This is outlined in README_create_vm_manually, and automated in remove-vm
	
	remove-vm is useful if a vm becomes corrupted, or if you want to create a new vm with the same hostname but new parameters such as disk size.
